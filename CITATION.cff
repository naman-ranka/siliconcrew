  SiliconCrew is a research prototype that explores the use of Large Language Models
  as autonomous agents for digital hardware design. Given a natural language specification,
  the agent generates synthesizable RTL, writes self-checking testbenches, iterates on
  verification failures using waveform and synthesis log analysis, and produces physical
  design outputs through the OpenROAD flow targeting SkyWater 130nm.
